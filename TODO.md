add icons or change menu for popup<br>

html local storage <br>
-tabs<br>
-or some other solution to this problem (maybe just the blank slate button)<br>

gray icon/message for domains on which it does not run <br>

maybe get rid of clusters when all are unpinned?<br>

refresh all on update/install?<br>

make popup come back when switching groups, if this is possible<br>
