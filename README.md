<h5>What is it?</h5>
Tab Team is a Chrome extension to organize tabs into groups.

<h5>Why do I need it?</h5>
You frequently manage to clutter Google Chrome with many tabs at once, which makes it more difficult to navigate through your projects.
 
<h5>Where can I get it?</h5>
You can get Tab Team from [the chrome web store] or from <a href="http://github.com/blackstache/tab_team">github.</a>

<h5>How do I use it?</h5>
Use the icon in the upper-right corner of the browser to:
<ul>
<li>Cycle from one group of tabs to the next. Keyboard shortcut: <b>ctrl-shift-x</b></li>

<li>Pin all tabs to the left of the current tab into a new group. Keyboard shortcut: <b>ctrl-shift-z</b></li>

<li>Unpin all tabs and reset groups.</li>

<li>Is that fraction showing tab group information annoying? Click this to make it go away (or come back).</li>

<li>Refresh all tabs.</li>

<li>Visit our website!</li>
</ul>
